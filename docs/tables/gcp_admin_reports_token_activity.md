# Table: gcp_admin_reports_token_activity - Query GCP Admin Reports Token Activity Events using SQL

Google Admin Reports Token Activity captures events related to OAuth and API tokensâ€”such as token authorization (connections to other services using Google account) and revocation. 

## Table Usage Guide

Use the `gcp_admin_reports_token_activity` table to monitor token lifecycle events, detect unauthorized token usage, and audit application integrations.

## Examples

### Basic info

Retrieve token activity events in the last 24 hours.

```sql
select
  time,
  actor_email,
  event_name,
  app_name
from
  gcp_admin_reports_token_activity
where
  time > now() - '1 day'::interval;
```

### Token activity related to a specific app

Identify event related to the Google Chrome app over the last week.

```sql
select
  time,
  actor_email,
  event_name
from
  gcp_admin_reports_token_activity
where
  app_name = 'Google Chrome'
  and time > now() - '7 days'::interval;
```

### Token revocations for a user

Show all token deletion events by [alice@example.com] in the past 2 days.

```sql
select
  time,
  event_name,
  app_name
from
  gcp_admin_reports_token_activity
where
  actor_email = 'alice@example.com'
  and event_name = '[revoke]'
  and time > now() - '2 days'::interval;
```

### Custom time window audit

Query token activity between two specific timestamps.

```sql
select
  time,
  actor_email,
  event_name,
  app_name
from
  gcp_admin_reports_token_activity
where
  time between '2025-06-01T00:00:00Z' and '2025-06-07T23:59:59Z';
```
